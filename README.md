## A Minimal Wordpress Framework for Rapid Development and Deployment

### This is totally not usable yet

But eventually will be integrating Timber as the View Layer, A Semi-Datamapper Pattern for Database Operations, and uses Grunt and Composer to completely handle task running and dependancy management. Best part? It aims to be 100% tested and can run faster than normal deploys, thanks to Timber/Twig Cache.

My goal with this framework is make wordpress development more accessible to developers coming from frameworks like Rails and Django.
